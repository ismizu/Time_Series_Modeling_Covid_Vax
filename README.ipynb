From data cleaning, to preparing models, to creating each figure; the individual pieces were designed to process each state's outcome through the use of scripts. Thus, when the data is updated, each piece can rapidly be re-run to create the final product."

    "However, I viewed the trade-off in a positive light. The first usage, predictions of rates, is still fulfilled. Despite a lowered rate of accuracy, the ability to visualize what might happen, and what could have been, is something I view as more invaluable. Thus, I view the trade-off as a worthy loss."
